Twitter Clone
=============

by <a href="http://duanemoody.io" target="_blank">Duane M. Moody</a>.

Twitter Clone is a simple application that allows users to post a message and allows others to provide a response to that message.

Epicodus Coursework Objectives
------------------------------

* To start, hard-code some tweets into your ```store.js``` file and list them out when your app loads.
* Next, add the ability to create a tweet (hint: in order to add an object to the model, you'll have to use ```addObject()``` instead of ```push()```). Make sure that tweets are sorted by the date they were tweeted, with the newest on top. Remember that tweets can only be 141 characters!
* If a user clicks on a tweet, expand it to show what time it was created.
* Allow a user to reply to a tweet and list those replies on the expanded view of a tweet.
* Add ability to add hashtags (i.e. #AwesomeSauce).
* Then be able to view all tweets by a certain hashtag.
